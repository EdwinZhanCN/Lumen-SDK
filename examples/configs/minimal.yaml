# Minimal Configuration - Edge Devices
# Designed for resource-constrained edge devices with limited CPU and memory

# Service Discovery - Minimal configuration
discovery:
    enabled: true
    service_type: "_lumen._tcp"
    domain: "local"
    scan_interval: 60s              # Less frequent scans to save CPU
    node_timeout: 10m               # Longer timeout for unstable connections
    max_nodes: 5                    # Limit discovered nodes to reduce memory usage

# Connection - Conservative settings
connection:
    dial_timeout: 10s               # Longer timeout for unreliable networks
    keep_alive: 60s                 # Longer keep-alive to reduce reconnections
    max_message_size: 2097152       # 2MB limit to save memory
    insecure: false
    compression: true               # Save bandwidth

# Server - Minimal services
server:
    rest:
        enabled: true
        host: "0.0.0.0"
        port: 8080
        cors: false                 # Disable CORS to save CPU
        timeout: 60s                # Longer timeout for slow edge processing

    mcp:
        enabled: false               # Disable MCP to save resources

    llmtools:
        enabled: false               # Disable LLM tools to save resources

# Load Balancer - Simple and efficient
load_balancer:
    strategy: "round_robin"         # Simple strategy, minimal CPU
    cache_enabled: true             # Cache to reduce repeated requests
    cache_ttl: 10m                  # Longer cache to save bandwidth
    health_check: false             # Disable health checks to save CPU
    default_timeout: 60s            # Longer default timeout for edge processing

# Logging - Minimal output
logging:
    level: "warn"                   # Only log warnings and errors
    format: "text"                  # Text format saves CPU compared to JSON
    output: "stdout"

# Monitoring - Disabled to save resources
monitoring:
    enabled: false                   # Disable monitoring to save CPU/memory

# Optimizations for Edge Devices:
# - Fewer service discovery scans
# - Limited concurrent connections
# - Longer timeouts for unstable networks
# - Minimal logging output
# - No health monitoring
# - Request caching enabled
# - Small message size limits
